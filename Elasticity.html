## Review

**Law of demand**

--

Law of demand states that there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded for a good or service.

--

**Revenue**  is the total amount of income generated by the sale of goods and services:

`$$Revenue=P \times Q$$`
--

**Absolute Value** is the distance of a number from the origin (e.g.,  |-3|=3 )

## Introduction : Do Soda Taxes Work?

&lt;img src="1.png" width="350px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

 A number of cities have enacted taxes on soda and other sweetened beverages. Do these taxes work?

--

 - the tax can have positive health effects by reducing the sugar consumption
 
--

 - the tax also raises funds (tax revenues) for public projects

--

`$$Revenue=P \times Q$$`
--

`$$Tax~ revenues=Tax \times Q$$`

???
The tax revenue a city raises equals the tax per ounce of soda multiplies by the number of ounces of soda sold.

Example:
 
`$$Tax~ revenues=1.5~ (cents) \times 6 ~(billions)=90 ~million~ dollars$$`
eg: if the tax is 1.5 cents per ounce, and 6 billion of soda sold, the tax will raise $90 mil

Interestingly, these goals partially conflict: The tax raises the prices consumers pay for sodas, the quantity demanded decreases. The greater the decline in the quantity of sodas, the greater the health effect of the tax...but the less revenue the city will raise form the tax.

All soda producers (and supermarkets) have a financial incentive to determine how much their sales will change as they increase or decrease price.

Government also have an incentive to determine how consumers will react if the price of product rises due to to a tax increase.
 
--

How can we know what the actual outcome will be?

--

  -  **Elasticity**- *which allows us to measure the responsiveness of the quantity demanded or the quantity supplied to changes in the market price*

???
In this chapter, we will explore the important concept of elasticity, which allows us to measure the responsiveness of the quantity demanded and the quantity supplies to changes in the market price


---

### Introduction

As the price of sweetened beverages increase, we expect people will buy fewer of them. But how many fewer?


&lt;img src="2.png" width="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

How can we come up with a sensible way to measure how much quantity changes when price changes?

--

  - One idea is to look at the slope of the demand curve which tells us how much prices changes as quantity demanded changes
  
--
 
  - Drawback: The measurement of slope is sensitive to the units chosen for quantity and price
   (e.g. if we measure the price in cents rather than dollar the value of the slope changes dramatically)


---

## 1. The Price Elasticity of Demand and Its Measurement

#### Learning Objective: Define and calculate price elasticity of demand


To avoid this confusion, economists define an:

  - **Elasticity** a measure of how much one economic variable response to changes in another economic variable, based on **percentage changes** in the variables. 

--

Review: The **percentage change** is the change in some economics variable, usually from one period to the next, expressed as a percentage.
 
 
`$$Percentage ~change=\left(\frac{\text { Value in the second period }-\text { Value in the first period }}{\text { Value in the first period }}\right) \times 100$$`
--
`$$Percentage ~change~in~price~ ({\% \Delta P})=\frac{P_2-P_1}{P_1} \times100$$`

   - `\(\Delta\)` is the Greek letter delta. In the above equations it means "change in".

--

$$Percentage ~change~in~quantity~ ({\% \Delta Q})=\frac{Q_2-Q_1}{Q_1}\times100 $$


--

  - Percentage changes are not dependent on units of measurement.

---
### Define elasticity


**Elasticity** measures the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another.

`$$E_{xy}=\frac{\% \Delta X}{\% \Delta Y}$$`

--

 - *Review Question*: What are the factors that change the quantity demanded of a product?
 
--
 
 - Price, Consumer's Income, Price of related good.



---
### Price Elasticity of demand

&lt;img src="3.png" width="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

`$$E_{d}=\frac{\% \Delta Q_{d}}{\% \Delta P}$$`

  - The numerator is read "The percentage change in quantity demanded".
  
  - The denominator is read "The percentage change in price".



???
For example, a 10 percent decrease in the price of bagels results in 20% increase in quantity of bagels demanded: 20%/-10%=-2

Price elasticity of demand is not the same as the slope of the demand curve

### Elastic Demand and Inelastic Demand

**Inelastic Rubber** (eg. a brand new rubber) vs **Elastic Rubber** (eg. an used rubber) 


&lt;img src="rubber.jpeg" width="400px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Price Elasticity of demand:
`$$E_{d}=\frac{\% \Delta Q_{d}}{\% \Delta P}$$`

---
### Elastic Demand and Inelastic Demand

&lt;img src="7.png" width="500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--


**Inelastic demand:** The price elasticity of demand is less than 1 in absolute value. The percentage change in quantity demanded will be less than the percentage change in price

--
   - Quantity demanded is *not very responsive* to a change in price

--

**Elastic demand:** The price elasticity of demand is greater than 1 in absolute value. The percentage change in quantity demanded will be greater than the percentage change in price. 

--
   - Quantity demanded is *very responsive* to changes in price

--

**Unit elastic demand:**  The price elasticity of demand equals 1 in absolute value. The percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price.


???
-3 is a smaller number than -2, we say that price elasticity of -3 is larger than a price elasticity of -2. We often drop the minus sign and compare their absolute values.

P and Q are negatively correlated, price elasticity is always negative-- refer to absolute value

### PepsiCo (Example)

&lt;img src="4.png" width="500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


  “PepsiCo said it started increasing prices in the summer and will maintain the increases into fiscal 2022, partly to combat rising production costs. The coronavirus pandemic is causing disruptions to global supply chains that are then leading to price increases of materials, labor, and freight. ”

 "Businesses like PepsiCo need to decide between absorbing the higher costs and accepting lower profit margins or passing those costs along to consumers."

"PepsiCo management's estimations on its price elasticity are likely informed by decades of proprietary data from tracking how consumers reacted to its past prices increases. PepsiCo has chosen to increase the prices consumers pay."

### PepsiCo (Question)	

Assume that :
   - the price of Pepsi rises by `\(10 \%\)`, ( `\(\% \Delta P=\%10\)`)

   - the quantity demanded for Pepsi falls by `\(1 \%,~ (\% \Delta Q_{d}=-\%1)\)`

--

**What is the absolute value of price elasticity of demand for Pepsi to be ?**

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;   10
  &lt;li&gt;   1
  &lt;li&gt;  .1
  &lt;li&gt;   0

&lt;/ol&gt;  


--

**Answer:** Price Elasticity of demand:
`$$|E_{d}|=\frac{|\% \Delta Q_{d}|}{|\% \Delta P|}=\frac{|-1|}{|10|}=.1$$`
Plugging in `\(\% \Delta Q_{d}=-1\)` and `\(\% \Delta P=10\)`


---

### PepsiCo (Questions)	

**What can you say about the demand of Pepsi?**

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;  the demand is inelastic
  &lt;li&gt;   the demand is elastic
  &lt;li&gt;   the demand is unit elastic
  &lt;li&gt;  the demand is perfect elastic

&lt;/ol&gt;  

--

**What would happen if  the quantity demanded is very responsive to changes in price?**
**The percentage change in quantity demanded will be:**

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;  less than the percentage change in price
  &lt;li&gt;  greater than the percentage change in price
  &lt;li&gt;  equal to the percentage change in price
  &lt;li&gt;  unrelated to the percentage change in price

&lt;/ol&gt;  

---

### An example of calculating price elasticities

&lt;img src="9.png" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

### The Midpoint Formula


`$$Price ~elasticity~ of~ demand ~(\varepsilon_{d})=\frac{\left(Q_{2}-Q_{1}\right)}{\left(\frac{Q_{1}+Q_{2}}{2}\right)} \div \frac{\left(P_{2}-P_{1}\right)}{\left(\frac{P_{1}+P_{2}}{2}\right)}$$`

  - This first term is the percentage change in quantity. Denominator is the average quantities instead of the initial quantity
  - The second term is the percentage change in price. Denominator is the average prices instead of the initial price.
  
&lt;img src="9.png" width="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



???
The advantage of the midpoint method is that one obtains the same elasticity between two price points whether there is a price increase or decrease. This is because the formula uses the same base for both cases.


---

### The Midpoint Formula

  - **Step 1.** Calculate the averages

`$$\frac{Q_{1}+Q_{2}}{2}=\frac{2000+25000}{2}=2,250~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\frac{P_{1}+P_{2}}{2}=\frac{1.5+1.3}{2}=1.4$$`

--

  - **Step 2.** Calculate the percentage change

`$$\frac{\left(Q_{2}-Q_{1}\right)}{\left(\frac{Q_{1}+Q_{2}}{2}\right)}=\frac{2500-2000}{2250}\times 100=22.2\%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\frac{\left(P_{2}-P_{1}\right)}{\left(\frac{P_{1}+P_{2}}{2}\right)}=\frac{1.3-1.5}{1.4}\times 100=-14.3\%$$`


--

  - **Step 3.** Calculate the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand


 `$$|\varepsilon_{d}|=|=\frac{\left(Q_{2}-Q_{1}\right)}{\left(\frac{Q_{1}+Q_{2}}{2}\right)} \div \frac{\left(P_{2}-P_{1}\right)}{\left(\frac{P_{1}+P_{2}}{2}\right)}| =\frac{|22.2 \%|}{|-14.3 \%|}=1.6$$`


---
### The Midpoint Formula (Exercise)

**Calculate the price elasticity of demand between A and C.**


&lt;img src="9.png" width="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---







### Perfectly Inelastic Demand Curve

A vertical demand curve means that quantity demanded does not change as price changes.
  - So elasticity is zero.
  - A vertical demand curve is perfectly inelastic.

&lt;img src="10.png" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**Perfectly inelastic demand**: The case where the quantity demanded is completely unresponsive to price and the price elasticity of demand equals zero.

---
### Perfectly Elastic Demand Curve

A horizontal demand curve means quantity demanded is infinitely responsive to price changes.
  - Elasticity is infinite.
  - A horizontal demand curve is perfectly elastic.

&lt;img src="11.png" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**Perfectly elastic demand**: The case where the quantity demanded is infinitely responsive to price and the price elasticity of demand equals infinity.

## 2 The Determinants of the Price Elasticity of Demand

#### Objective: List and explain the determinants of the price elasticity of demand.

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;  The availability of close substitutes
&lt;/ol&gt;  

  - If a product has more substitutes available, it will have more elastic demand.
  
--
   - Example: There are many substitutes for Books (sold at Barnes &amp; Nobles), so their price elasticity of demand is high.
   - Example: There are few substitutes for gasoline, so its price elasticity of demand is low.

--


&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Whether the good is a luxury or a necessity
&lt;/ol&gt; 

  - People are more flexible with luxuries than necessities, so price elasticity of demand is higher for luxuries.
  
--

  - Example: Many people consider milk and bread necessities; they will buy them every week almost regardless of the price.


---
### Determinants of the price elasticity of demand



&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The passage of time
&lt;/ol&gt; 

  - Over time, people can adjust their buying habits more easily. Elasticity is higher in the long run than the short run.
  
--

  - Example: If the price of gasoline rises, it takes a while for people to adjust their gasoline consumption. How might they do that?
    - Buying a more fuel-efficient car
    - Moving closer to work

---
### Determinants of the price elasticity of demand



&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The definition of the market
&lt;/ol&gt; 

  - The more narrowly defined the market, the more substitutes are available, and hence the more elastic is demand.

--
  - Example: You might believe there is no good substitute for jeans, so your demand for jeans is very inelastic.
  - But if you consider different brands of jeans, you might be more sensitive to the price of a particular brand.

---
### Determinants of the price elasticity of demand


&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The share of a good in a consumer’s budget
&lt;/ol&gt; 

  - If a good is a small portion of your budget, you will likely not be very sensitive to its price.
--

 - Example: You might buy table salt once a year or less; changes in its price will not affect very much how much you buy.

## 3. The Relationship Between Price Elasticity of Demand and  Revenue
#### Learning Objectives: Explain the relationship between the price elasticity of demand and total revenue.

If you are a business owner, you need to decide how to price your product.

  - “How many customers will I gain if I cut my price?”
  
  - “What will happen to my total revenue if I cut my price?”


Knowing the price elasticity of demand for your product can help to answer these questions.

 Revenue: The total amount of funds a seller receives from selling a good or service, calculated by multiplying price per unit by the number of units sold.

`$$Revenue=P \times Q$$`

### Effect of Cutting Price with Different Elasticities

*Suppose demand for your product is relatively price inelastic:*

  - Customers are not very sensitive to the price of your product.
  - An increase in the price results in minimal loss of consumers.
  - The increase in price will compensate for the loss of consumers, so overall revenue increases.
